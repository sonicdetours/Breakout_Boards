Breakout Boards
---------------

A couple of handy breakout boards boards for prototyping Little Drum Machines and other stuff. Oliver Gillet's "breadboard friends" were used as a starting point for the PCB layouts.

IMPORTANT: Dimensions vary slightly between breadboards from different manufacturers. Be sure to check that the PCB layouts match your board before you start etching.
