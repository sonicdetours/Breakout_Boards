Breakout Boards
---------------

A couple of handy breakout boards boards for prototyping stuff. Oliver Gillet's "breadboard friends" were used as a starting point for the PCB layouts.

Note that dimensions vary slightly between breadboards from different manufacturers. Be sure to check that the PCB layouts match your board before you start etching!
